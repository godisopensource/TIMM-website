      "content": "Hi! I\u0026rsquo;m Paul ðŸ‘‹ Having loved music from an early age, and composing in my spare time, I am currently an I.T. engineer at Orange France. Let\u0026rsquo;s get to know each other!\nMy musical repertoire I still remember the day I got my first MP3 pocket player. It was pretty much empty, so we loaded Amy Winehouse\u0026rsquo;s legendary Back to Black album onto it. And that\u0026rsquo;s how it all started. A subscription to the library gave me access to many other artists, and when I was putting the records in my hi-fi system, the magic was happening. When I went home from primary school at lunchtime, I read the same albums over and over again: R.E.M., Tony Bennett classics, MichaÃ«l BublÃ©, Ron Sexmith\u0026hellip;\nSince then, discovering new music has remained a passion for me. I am open to all musical styles, but am especially passionate about jazz.\nMy compositions Like many other teenagers, it started with poetry. I wrote around 800 poems in a year, published a book, and then suddenly lost all inspiration. Then a year later, one day after a concert, I woke up unusually early with a melody in my head that I knew I had invented during my sleep. I got up straight away and recorded it on the piano. To be honest, it was pretty damn bad. But the unique feeling of joy of being able to put an emotion down on the keyboard was unique, and has never left me since.\nInitially identified by the name godisopensource, I decided to assert a style closer to jazz in my latest artist name to date: Detlar. It is no coincidence that this name corresponds to my surname, but in reverse; it reflects the rupture of styles that is the guiding principle of my work. It is the same for the mascot character on my artist page: a traditional outfit (shirt, suit trousers), and sunglasses of a different style to break it up. My music is precisely at the intersection of inspirations from all horizons, to which I have trained my ear.\nI could list thousands of artists who inspire me every day - which I will not - but I will mention the legendary Avishai Cohen, Asaf Avidan, Tigran Hamasyan, Bill Laurance, GoGo Penguin, Hania Rani\u0026hellip;\nLegend has it that if I don\u0026rsquo;t get my daily dose of these artists, I won\u0026rsquo;t have a good day\u0026hellip;\nYou can listen to my music on every streaming platform, but here is a little preview of my work through Spotify (no need for a Spotify account):\nAbout this website I have a lot of friends who are musicians and music enthusiasts, so artist/music advice often flows between us. Thanks to the digital age, there are an infinite number of ways of discovering new music, and that really is something that fascinates me. I feel extremely privileged when I discover a new, little-known artist who immediately becomes a favourite.\nThe aim of this blog is to share my discoveries.\nObviously, you may not like all the styles, and that is entirely understandable, which is why I have assigned labels to the articles, to make your visit easier.\nIf you would like to get in touch, please reach me at contact@paullardet.anonaddy.me\n"
